        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a student of front end web development, just starting out after getting out of the robot dino game.  I have spent the past few months learning as much as I can about front-end web and absorbing as much knowledge as I can to build new skills in an industry I've loved since I was a kid.</p>
        <br></br>
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I have an interest in self-improvement and have been pushing myself more recently to stick to routines I create for myself.  I love art, origami, planning, coordinating, and learning new skills.  I also love to cook!</p>
